    "\n",
    "In the expression optimisation problem you are given a list of numbers and a list of arithmetic operations. The goal is to determine the optimal order in which to apply these operations to maximise the result of the arithmetic expression. The operations in the expression should be performed in BODMAS order. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are asked to implement and run a Genetic Algorithm to determine the optimal sequence of operations. More specifically, you will be provided with a list of n integers (e.g., numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and a corresponding list of operations that must be applied in the final expression (e.g., operations = [\"/\", \"\\*\", \"+\", \"-\"]).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Task 1. Implementation of class ExpressionOptimisationProblem\n",
    "Your first task is to complete the ExpressionOptimisationProblem class, which will manage the optimisation process described above. Specifically, you will need to implement the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- select: Select a candidate from the population based on a probability function. You may use the probability function discussed in the lectures or design your own. If the population is empty, initialise a candidate randomly.\n",
    "- cross: Perform a crossover operation between two candidates.\n",
    "- mutate: Apply a mutation to a candidate based on a given mutation probability, or return an unaltered copy of the candidate.\n",
    "- fitness: Calculate the fitness of a given candidate. This function should be used in the select method when computing probabilities for candidate selection.\n",
    "- encode: Encode a candidate into a different representation, if necessary.\n",
    "- decode: Decode a candidate from its encoded representation back into the original format.\n",
    "- compute: Compute the result of the expression given a list of operations\n",
