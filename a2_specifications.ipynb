    "In the expression optimisation problem you are given a list of numbers and a list of arithmetic operations. The goal is to determine the optimal order in which to apply these operations to maximise the result of the arithmetic expression. The operations in the expression should be performed in BODMAS order. \n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are asked to implement and run a Genetic Algorithm to determine the optimal sequence of operations. More specifically, you will be provided with a list of n integers (e.g., numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and a corresponding list of operations that must be applied in the final expression (e.g., operations = [\"/\", \"\\*\", \"+\", \"-\"]).\n",

    "Your first task is to complete the ExpressionOptimisationProblem class, which will manage the optimisation process described above. Specifically, you will need to implement the following methods:\n",

    "- select: Select a candidate from the population based on a probability function. You may use the probability function discussed in the lectures or design your own. If the population is empty, initialise a candidate randomly.\n",
    "- cross: Perform a crossover operation between two candidates.\n",
    "- mutate: Apply a mutation to a candidate based on a given mutation probability, or return an unaltered copy of the candidate.\n",
    "- fitness: Calculate the fitness of a given candidate. This function should be used in the select method when computing probabilities for candidate selection.\n",
    "- encode: Encode a candidate into a different representation, if necessary.\n",
    "- decode: Decode a candidate from its encoded representation back into the original format.\n",

    "**Your Answer:**\n",
    "The fitness function measures how well a candidate solution meets the problem's requirements. In this case, fitness is calculated using the compute() method, which evaluates the result of an arithmetic expression based on the initialized numbers and the order of operations. This approach works well because it directly aligns with the assignment's objective, which is to maximize the value of the expression. A higher fitness value indicates that the candidate solution is closer to achieving the desired outcome, meaning it is better adapted to the problem environment. Thus, candidates with higher fitness values are more likely to survive and reproduce in subsequent iterations, leading to the evolution of more optimal solutions."

    "\n",
    "The termination condition is designed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the offspring are not empty, the algorithm checks if the best candidate in the offspring has a better fitness than the historical best. If so, it updates the best candidate.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Your answer:**\n",
    "Based on the experiment, the observed trends are:\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller population size tends to result in a lower average result.\n",
    "A larger population size generally leads to a lower average number of iterations required for convergence.\n",
    "Justification: A smaller population size means fewer opportunities for crossover, leading to fewer offspring. With fewer candidates, the genetic diversity is limited, making it harder to escape local optima and find the global optimum. This is why a smaller population size results in a lower average result, as the algorithm may settle on suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, a larger population size provides more opportunities for genetic diversity, allowing the algorithm to explore a wider range of solutions. This increases the likelihood of finding better solutions and speeds up convergence, as evidenced by the reduced number of iterations needed. Thus, with a larger population, the algorithm efficiently converges to optimal solutions, avoiding local optima."

    "For parameter selection, it was observed that a population size of 300 significantly increased computation time and memory usage, while a size of 100 did not consistently yield optimal results. A larger population size increases the diversity of the gene pool, which is crucial for finding optimal solutions. A higher crossover probability (pc) ensures sufficient genetic mixing to explore new potential solutions, while a lower mutation probability (pm) is maintained to prevent excessive random alterations, ensuring that advantageous traits are not lost.\n",
